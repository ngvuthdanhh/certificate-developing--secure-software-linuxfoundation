# Threat Modeling Workshop

## Objective
Practice identifying threats and designing mitigations using structured methodologies.

---

## Exercise 1: E-commerce Application
- Draw a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for:
  - Customer → Website → Database → Payment Gateway.  
- Identify threats using **STRIDE**.  
- Suggest mitigations for each threat.

---

## Exercise 2: REST API
- Model a REST API with authentication and sensitive data transfer.  
- Identify attack surface (endpoints, tokens, storage).  
- Apply **PASTA** or **Kill Chain** approach.

---

## Exercise 3: Cloud Deployment
- Scenario: Web app deployed on Kubernetes with CI/CD.  
- Identify risks in:
  - Supply chain (malicious dependencies).  
  - Misconfigurations (open S3 buckets, exposed dashboards).  
  - Runtime threats (container escape).  
- Propose mitigations.

---

## Deliverables
- Data flow diagrams.  
- Threat list.  
- Mitigation strategies linked to security principles.
