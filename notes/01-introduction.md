# Module 1: Introduction

## Why Secure Software Matters
- High cost of insecure software (financial, reputation, legal).  
- Security as a quality attribute, not an afterthought.  

## Key Concepts
- Vulnerabilities vs. Exploits vs. Threats.  
- Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC).  

## Frameworks
- OWASP, NIST SSDF, SLSA.  

## Takeaways
Security must be built into every stage of the software lifecycle, not bolted on later.
